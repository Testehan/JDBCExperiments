You need to start the Postgres app in order to have the DB functional. (https://postgresapp.com/)
Also you can use pgAdmin 4 in order to have a UI editor.

In DB "danteshte", in schema "public", I created a table "movie" which will be used through this app.

When you run "mvn clean install" a default profile is chosen. If you want another profile you just need
to run "mvn clean install -P test", and in this case, the DB connection will be made to another database (see in the
profile the url)

In order to run the app, do use the command "mvn exec:java" . This will run the main class configured
in the pom file.
