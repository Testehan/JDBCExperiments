You need to start the Postgres app in order to have the DB functional. (https://postgresapp.com/)
Also you can use pgAdmin 4 in order to have a UI editor.

In DB "danteshte", in schema "public", I created a table "movie" which will be used through this app.

In order to run the app, do use the command "mvn exec:java" . This will run the main class configured
in the pom file.
